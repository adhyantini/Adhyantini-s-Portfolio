            I graduated student from Northeastern University where I pursued my MS in Information Systems. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.
            {/* <br/> */}
            Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on exciting projects in web development, cloud infrastructure, and automation, and I thrive on the constant learning that comes with it. 
            {/* <br/> */}
            With a strong background in <b className="purple">Node.js, Python, Java, and JavaScript,</b> I enjoy solving complex problems through clean, efficient code. 
            {/* <br /> */}
            My experience spans both  <b className="purple">cloud computing</b> and <b className="purple">DevOps,</b> specifically with <b className="purple">Google Cloud Platform (GCP),</b> where I design and deploy scalable infrastructures.
            {/* <br/> */}
